# Changelog

## 2026.2

Hardening & polish release, based on a full code audit.

### Security
- **Track-title AI cleanup is now sandboxed.** The untrusted ICY stream title is passed to the optional `claude` CLI via stdin with `--allowedTools "" --strict-mcp-config`, so a malicious station name can no longer trigger any tool/command execution.

### Accessibility
- Custom round buttons are now exposed to screen readers (Orca) and are keyboard-reachable (Tab) and activatable (Space/Enter), with a visible focus ring.

### Fixes
- **MPRIS:** `Stop`/`Pause` no longer start playback — only `PlayPause` toggles.
- **MPRIS:** state/command files and the D-Bus bus name now derive from the stable per-applet id instead of a timestamp — no more orphaned "ghost" media entries after a Plasma restart, and two widget instances no longer collide.
- **Downloads:** a missing `yt-dlp` now shows a clear "yt-dlp is not installed" message instead of a confusing generic error.

### New settings (now exposed in the config UI)
- **Follow system accent color** — opt in to recolor the whole UI with your Plasma accent instead of the built-in emerald theme (off by default).
- Download **format** (best / mp3 / opus / mp4), download **folder**, and the optional **title cleanup** toggle are now all configurable from Settings.

### Housekeeping
- All source comments translated to English.
- Cleaned up package metadata (license, authors, removed stale localized descriptions); default download folder is `~/Music/OnAir`.
